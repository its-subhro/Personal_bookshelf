1. **Clone the Repository**: First, you need to clone the GitHub repository of the React application to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/its-subhro/Personal_bookshelf.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd Personal Bookshelf
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Once you're inside the project directory, you need to install the dependencies required for the project. Run the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, you can run the application. With Vite, you can use the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Once the application has started, you can access it in your web browser by navigating to the URL provided in the terminal. By default, Vite runs the application on `localhost` at port `3000`, so you can access it by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
